Hi there ðŸ‘‹  I am Tanya, a Data Scientist by the virtue of my role at Eagleview. My previous work experience in this domain includes having worked in the medical domain at Sigtuple, enhancing catalogues and recommendations of fashion stories at Charmboard, and developing end-to-end forecasting pipelines at an agrotech startup, Credible India.

I love to spend most of my time on research, reading and implementing research papers on the Computer Vision domain, I constantly try to figure out new applications for an idea, and I try to be informed about the latest developments.

I am a continuous practitioner of the learning-by-doing philosophy and extend this to any problem in these spheres, and aim to provide value to any project I am tasked (or task myself) upon.

My projects include the following:
- Tensorflow2.x implementation of Deep Lab V3 plus, which is a state-of-the-art model for semantic segmentation.
- End-to-end development of densely packed Object Detection using Single Shot Multibox Detector.
- DINO, a Vision Transformers training with the Self-Supervised learning
- Depth Estimation using Self Supervised Learning
- Super Resolution GANs with Model Quantization
- Colorization of images using Conditional GANs
